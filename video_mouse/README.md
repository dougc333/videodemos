Cover: 
1) difference between window.onload() and jquery $(document).ready. window.onload is valid when all the images are loaded. jquery document ready true when dom loaded and images not yet all loaded
2) adding event listeners and coordinate system for clientX, clientY relative to window/browser and div element



1) TestChrome.html plays video works in Firefox not in Chrome. To test open in pycharm right click open in browser select Firefox or Chrome
2) TestImageDraw.html broken. 
3) TestImageDraw2.html doesnt do shit
4) testmousedown.html: display mouse coordinates in left div, test event bubbling/capture
5) testmousepos.html: display mouse coordinates in div. What is diff w/above? Less code. 
6) TestVideoSource. bottom is color image top is grayscale image. 
7) canvas_imagedata.html test reading and writing canvas frame buffer
8) 2canvas.html draw rectangle onto canvas. 
9) test_requestanimationframe.html. Shouldnt use setTimeout like in TestVideoSource should use requestAnimationFrame
which is controlled by browser v.s. guessing when next frame is ready by timeout.
